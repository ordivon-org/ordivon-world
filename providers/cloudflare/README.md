# Ordivon Cloudflare Provider

## Scope

Provide a signed adapter for bounded remote Fetch and same-origin Browser snapshot work, authoritative request state, replayable Receipts, private R2 Artifacts, and version-bound release operations.

## Supported operations

The supported surface is `fetch.v2`, `browser.snapshot.v2`, `receipt.v2`, authenticated Artifact retrieval, release, rollback, lifecycle configuration, and bounded garbage collection. The exact callable set is reported by the deployed capability endpoint and must match local policy and source identity.

## Authority boundary

Cloudflare owns Worker versions, Deployments, Browser and Fetch execution, R2 request state, lease generations, Receipts, and Artifact objects. The adapter owns signed Request ID and input binding plus client verification. Host retains Task, Effect, uncertainty, Verification, and completion authority.

## Limitations

Fetch is allowlisted HTTPS GET with bounded redirects, time, and bytes. Browser supports navigation and snapshot only; no caller scripts, cookies, credentials, arbitrary headers, clicks, forms, or downloads are accepted. The provider is not a general browser automation service, callback authority, provider broker, or workflow engine.

A signed provider adapter for bounded remote Fetch and Browser work.

## Active capabilities

- `fetch.v2` — allowlisted HTTPS fetch with bounded redirects, time, and bytes;
- `browser.snapshot.v2` — same-origin Browser Rendering snapshot;
- `receipt.v2` — pending state, fenced leases, exact Request ID/input binding, replay, and reconciliation;
- private R2 Artifact retrieval with digest and byte verification;
- versioned release, rollback, lifecycle, and garbage collection.

The provider owns Cloudflare execution state and objects. It does not own Host Task meaning or completion.

## Commands

```bash
ordivon-edge health
ordivon-edge capabilities
ordivon-edge fetch https://example.com/
ordivon-edge browser-run https://example.com/ --full-page
ordivon-edge receipt <request-id> --wait
ordivon-edge artifact-get <key> --output ./artifact.bin --sha256 <digest>

sudo ordivon-edge-release release
sudo ordivon-edge-release rollback
sudo ordivon-edge-gc run
```

Installed operations resolve `/root/projects/ordivon-world/providers/cloudflare` by default. Override with `ORDIVON_WORLD_REPO` when necessary. Release and GC receipts are private under `/root/backups/ordivon-world/`.

## Release behavior

A release is skipped when the active Worker already has the same Worker-input digest. The controller accepts any reconstructable Git commit; unrelated repository state does not block a Worker release, while dirty Worker inputs do.

For a changed Worker, the controller uploads a zero-traffic candidate, verifies one version-bound health observation, checks policy and capability identity, runs only the affected Fetch or Browser smoke where the change is capability-local, promotes the candidate, verifies one non-override health observation, and writes a private receipt. Ambiguous control-plane responses are reconciled through Cloudflare before any retry.

## Why retained

Fetch and Browser could be called directly, but direct calls would lose Ordivon's stable signed Request ID, exact input binding, transactional Receipt, response-loss reconciliation, private Artifact contract, and source-input release identity. These are the adapter's non-replaceable functions.

See `docs/operations.md`, `docs/reliability.md`, `docs/release.md`, and `docs/security.md`.
